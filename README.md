## The C Programming Language

This repo contains classic snippets from the "The C Programming Language" written by Kernighan and Ritchie in 1988.

To run the examples, type the following commands in a terminal
```sh
# compile
gcc -ansi -o file_name file_name.c

#run
./file_name
```
The "-ansi" flag sets the compilation standard to C90. 
The "-o" flat renames the executable binary to a file name of your choice instead of the default "a.out".
